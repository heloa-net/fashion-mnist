# Fashion MNIST classifier 

I'm teaching myself machine learning and this is one of the projects I'm using for this goal.

Currently I have a baseline created by calculating the distance between the image of a clothing item from the dataset against the "average" of that item. The average was determined by averaging each pixel in all the images for each category of clothing item. It's very interesting to visualize it!
